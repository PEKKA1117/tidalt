# CLAUDE.md

## Build & tooling

- **Go version**: 1.26+
- **Format**: run `gofumpt -w .` after writing or editing any `.go` file
- **Lint (Go)**: run `golangci-lint run` (v2) before finishing a task; fix all reported issues
- **Lint (C)**: run `./lint-c.sh` after editing any `.c`/`.h` file (containerised clang-tidy; `LINT_C_NATIVE=1` to use a local clang-tidy). Config in `.clang-tidy` — its `Checks:` block is a YAML folded scalar and must not contain `#` comments
- **Build**: `go build ./...`
- **CGO**: required — the player package links against libasound (`-lasound`)

## Package overview

### `cmd/tidalt`
Entry point. Handles signal setup, session load/restore from the secrets store, OAuth2 device-flow login on first run, and launches the BubbleTea TUI program.

### `internal/tidal`
Tidal API client.
- `client.go` — OAuth2 device-flow authentication, token refresh, authenticated HTTP client
- `api.go` — REST calls: favorites, search, track lookup, stream URL (quality ladder: HI_RES_LOSSLESS → LOSSLESS → HIGH → LOW), mixes, mix tracks, artist albums/top-tracks/all-tracks
- Daily Mixes use the v1 API: `GET /v1/pages/my_collection_my_mixes` for the list, `GET /v1/mixes/{mixId}/items` for a mix's tracks (fully populated, one request). The v2 `openapi.tidal.com/v2/userRecommendations` resource was removed by Tidal and now 404s — do not reintroduce it. Video mixes and non-`track` items are filtered out, since the player cannot decode video

### `internal/player`
Bit-perfect FLAC playback via CGO + libasound.
- The hand-written C lives in real translation units, not cgo preamble comments: `alsa.h`/`alsa.c` (PCM open + format negotiation, used by `mpv.go`) and `avcodec.h`/`avcodec.c` (FFmpeg decode pipeline, used by `avcodec.go`). The Go files keep only a minimal preamble that `#include`s the header plus the `#cgo` linker directives. `avio_read_cb` is implemented in Go via `//export` and declared in `avcodec.h`
- Opens ALSA `hw:` devices directly, bypassing PipeWire/PulseAudio
- Negotiates the best PCM format the DAC supports using `snd_pcm_hw_params`. Resampling policy is stated explicitly per device via `snd_pcm_hw_params_set_rate_resample`: `0` on `hw:` (a no-op there, but it keeps the bit-perfect contract in the code instead of in an ALSA default), `1` on plug-layer devices
- Shared output mode: selecting `default` in the device picker plays through the system mixer instead of claiming the card. `IsSharedDevice`/`isPlugDevice`/`alsaTuning` in `shared.go` drive the three things that differ — the ReserveDevice1 handshake is skipped (`reserveUnlessShared`), the ring buffer widens from 4 to 8 periods, and `bitPerfect` is false so the UI badge reads `(shared)`. Shared mode is never reached by a fallback; it only happens when the user picks it
- Falls back to `plughw:` only when format negotiation itself is refused — i.e. `configure_hw_pcm` fails, tagged with the `errFormatRefused` sentinel — as on fixed-format USB interfaces such as the Focusrite Vocaster. A busy device fails at `open_hw_device` instead, which carries the existing `-EBUSY` retry against `hw:` and is never downgraded. The fallback is memoised per device, and `alsaHandle.bitPerfect` / `Player.AudioPath` propagate the downgrade up to the UI so the quality badge and device readout stop claiming untouched output
- Format preference for 16-bit sources: S32_LE → S16_LE → S24_3LE → S24_LE (S32_LE first because some DACs, e.g. CS43198-based Hidizs S9 Pro Plus, have a broken S16_LE USB endpoint)
- Format preference for 24-bit sources: S24_3LE → S24_LE → S32_LE
- Acquires `org.freedesktop.ReserveDevice1.Audio{N}` on D-Bus before opening the device, asking PipeWire to release if it holds the reservation
- Demuxes and decodes the HTTP stream in-flight via FFmpeg (libavformat/libavcodec/libswresample, CGO) — FLAC, AAC/mp4, and ALAC — resampling to S32LE. A custom AVIO callback feeds bytes straight from the HTTP response. FFmpeg is linked dynamically for local/dev/CI builds (needs the distro's libav*-dev headers); the official distro packages (`packaging/`) bundle a minimal static FFmpeg built from source, selected with the `staticav` build tag
- Volume, pause, and position tracking via atomics
- Auto-detects known DACs (Hidizs S9 Pro, Hidizs S9 Pro Plus "Martha", Focusrite Scarlett Solo) from `/proc/asound/cards`

### `internal/store`
Persistent storage.
- OAuth2 session stored securely via `docker/secrets-engine` (system keychain, falling back to age-encrypted file at `~/.config/tidalt/secrets`)
- Volume, selected device, and track metadata cache stored in a bbolt database at `~/.local/share/tidalt/tidal-cache.db`

### `internal/ui`
BubbleTea TUI model (Model/Update/View).
- Five states: `StateBrowse`, `StateMixes`, `StateSearch`, `StateDeviceSelect`, `StateArtistAlbums`
- Scrollable track and mix lists with a visible window helper
- Artist view (`StateArtistAlbums`): opened with `a` on any track; lists the artist's albums plus "Play all tracks" / "Top tracks" entries, loading the chosen tracks into the browse queue
- Progress bar with playback position, volume display, and device label
- Auto-advances to the next track in the queue when playback finishes
