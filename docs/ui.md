# The TIDALT interface

TIDALT's terminal interface is built around a persistent **sidebar** on the left
and a **main content pane** on the right, with a now-playing bar and a
context-aware key-hint bar pinned along the bottom. This document is a tour of
how the pieces fit together.

## Layout

```

```

Focus lives in one of two zones at a time: the **sidebar** (you're choosing a
section) or the **main pane** (you're acting on the section's content). `h` and
`l` move focus between them; `Enter` on a sidebar item also jumps into the pane.

On narrow terminals the sidebar collapses to icons only (below ~62 columns) and
is hidden entirely below ~40 columns so the main pane stays usable.

## Sections

The sidebar groups every destination:

- **NOW**
  - **Queue** — the live playback queue with the cover art of the *hovered* track
    on the right (Kitty graphics where supported, Unicode block-art otherwise);
    moving the cursor previews each track's cover. The cover panel is hidden
    automatically when the terminal is too small to show it legibly, giving the
    full width back to the track list. See *The queue* below.
- **LIBRARY**
  - **Playlists** — a two-column view: the playlist index on the left, the
    selected playlist's tracks on the right. `Enter`/`→` opens a playlist;
    `Enter` in the detail loads it into the queue and starts playing.
  - **Songs / Artists / Albums** — your Tidal favorites, each as its own list.
    From an artist you can drill into an album to see its tracks.
  - **Recently Played** — recently played tracks, most recent first, persisted
    across sessions.
- **TIDAL**
  - **Daily Mixes** — your Tidal mixes; `Enter` loads a mix into the queue.
  - **Search** — see *Search* below.
- **SETTINGS**
  - **Themes** — the color-scheme picker (see *Themes*).

## The queue (hybrid model)

The queue is your **live workspace**. It is never a saved playlist by itself —
but it remembers where its contents came from, shown in the panel title:

| State | Header | Meaning |
| ----- | ------ | ------- |
| Loaded from a saved playlist, untouched | `QUEUE · <name> · synced` (green) | matches the saved playlist |
| Loaded from a playlist, then edited | `QUEUE · <name> · edited — S save` (amber) | you've added/reordered tracks |
| Built from radio or ad-hoc adds | `QUEUE · radio · unsaved — S save` (amber) | nothing saved yet |

Editing the queue (play-next, add-to-queue) **never** rewrites the saved
playlist it came from. Press `S` (or use the command palette's
*Save queue as playlist…*) to commit the current queue as a brand-new playlist;
*Save queue to existing playlist…* appends it to one you already have. A green
toast confirms the save.

`x` removes the selected track from the queue and `C` clears it (the current
track keeps playing in both cases).

### Following the playing track

When no key has been pressed for `follow_idle_sec` seconds (10 by default, set
in [app.toml](layout.md#following-the-playing-track)), the Queue cursor moves
back onto the playing track and scrolls it into view. In client mode this keeps
the queue in step with the running instance as it advances; in the running
instance it returns the cursor after you've browsed away (the cursor is also
where playback continues from).

- It only acts while the Queue is the open page, and is checked once a second,
  so the move can land up to a second after the idle time runs out.
- Any key press restarts the idle time.
- It waits while an overlay (action sheet, palette, help, …), the `/` find
  prompt, a half-typed key sequence (`g` of `g y`) or the artist view is open.
- Nothing moves when no track is playing, when the playing track isn't in the
  queue, or when the cursor is already on it. If the track is queued more than
  once, the cursor goes to its first occurrence.
- `follow_idle_sec = 0` turns it off.

## The action sheet

Press `o` on any track to open a contextual popup of actions, so the same set of
operations is available everywhere — queue, search results, playlist detail,
history:

- ▸ Play now · ⏭ Play next (`n`) · ＋ Add to queue (`e`)
- ≡ Add to playlist… · ∿ Start radio from this (`r`)
- ♫ Go to artist (`a`) · ⊞ Go to album (`A`)
- ♥ Favorite (`f`) · ⎘ Copy Tidal link (`c`)

Each action also has the single-key shortcut shown in parentheses, usable
directly on the list without opening the sheet.

## The command palette

Press `:` or `Ctrl+P` to open a fuzzy command palette. Type to filter, `j`/`k`
(or `Ctrl+J`/`Ctrl+K`) to move, `Enter` to run. It groups into:

- **ACTIONS** — *Save queue as playlist…*, *Save queue to existing playlist…*,
  *Clear queue*, *Import from Spotify…*
- **JUMP TO** — every sidebar section

## Importing from Spotify

*Import from Spotify…* (in the command palette) opens an overlay where you paste a
Spotify track or playlist URL. tidalt finds each song on Tidal, shows a review list
marking unmatched tracks as **not available**, and lets you either create a Tidal
playlist or load the matches into the queue. No Spotify login is needed. See
[spotify-import.md](spotify-import.md) for details and limitations.

## Search

Search queries Tidal across categories and groups the results into **SONGS**,
**ARTISTS**, and **ALBUMS**. The cursor moves across all groups; `Enter` does the
natural thing for the highlighted row — play a song, drill into an artist's
discography, or load an album into the queue. Track rows also accept the action
sheet and the `f`/`r` shortcuts. You can also paste a Spotify URL into the search
box to load the matched Tidal tracks straight into the queue.

## Themes

The **Themes** section is a live theme picker. Eight schemes ship built in —
TIDALT (the default slate look), Catppuccin Mocha, Tokyo Night, Gruvbox Dark,
Nord, Rosé Pine, Dracula, and Amber CRT — plus an **Auto — match terminal**
option that follows your terminal's own colors.

Moving the cursor with `j`/`k` **previews** the scheme by re-theming the whole
interface instantly; `Enter` applies and saves it, and `Esc` cancels the preview
and reverts. The chosen theme persists across launches. `t` cycles the theme
from anywhere in the app.

## Client mode

When a second TIDALT instance starts while one is already running, it launches in
**client mode**: it forwards playback to the running instance over D-Bus instead
of opening the audio device itself. A client instance is tinted with a
steel-blue accent and shows a `⇄ CLIENT` badge in the sidebar header, so it's
always clear which instance owns playback. The chosen theme still applies; only
the focus accent changes. See [client-server.md](client-server.md) for details.
