![tidalt TUI](docs/tui.png)

**tidalt** is a Tidal music player for Linux that delivers **bit-perfect, lossless audio** directly to your DAC — no PipeWire, no PulseAudio, no resampling. (A small number of USB interfaces expose a fixed native format and cannot be driven this way; see [fixed-format audio interfaces](#fixed-format-audio-interfaces).)

It is built on top of the Tidal API and can run in three ways:

- **Interactive TUI** — browse, search, and control playback from the terminal
- **Daemon** — headless background process, controlled via the TUI or any MPRIS2 client
- **Client** — lightweight TUI that forwards commands to a running daemon over D-Bus

All three modes share the same playback engine. The daemon holds exclusive access to the audio device only while a track is actually playing — releasing it on pause so other applications can use it freely.

> 100% vibe coded with [Claude](https://claude.ai) and [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com).

**Linux only.** Requires a Tidal HiFi or HiFi Plus subscription.

## Install

Pre-built packages are available on the [releases page](https://github.com/Benehiko/tidalt/releases).
The official Docker image is available at [`benehiko/tidalt`](https://hub.docker.com/r/benehiko/tidalt) — see [docs/docker.md](docs/docker.md) for usage.

### Arch Linux

```bash
sudo pacman -U tidalt-*.pkg.tar.zst
```

### Debian / Ubuntu

```bash
sudo dpkg -i tidalt_*.deb
sudo apt-get install -f
```

### Fedora

```bash
sudo dnf install tidalt-*.rpm
```

### Build packages locally with Docker

All packages (Arch, Debian, Fedora — amd64 and arm64) can be built locally
with a single command using Docker Buildx bake:

```bash
# One-time: create a multi-platform builder
docker buildx create --use

# Build all packages (replace VERSION as needed)
docker buildx bake \
  --file docker-bake.hcl \
  --set "*.args.VERSION=3.0.0" \
  --set "*.output=type=local,dest=dist"
```

Artifacts land in `dist/`:

```
dist/
  tidalt-3.0.0-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst   # Arch
  tidalt_3.0.0-1_amd64.deb            # Debian / Ubuntu (amd64)
  tidalt_3.0.0-1_arm64.deb            # Debian / Ubuntu (arm64)
  tidalt-3.0.0-1.fc43.x86_64.rpm      # Fedora (amd64)
  tidalt-3.0.0-1.fc43.aarch64.rpm     # Fedora (arm64)
```

To build a single target: append `debian`, `arch`, or `fedora` to the command.

See [docs/installation.md](docs/installation.md) for building packages locally
without Docker or installing from source.

### Post-install

Register the `tidal://` URL handler so clicking **"Open in desktop app"** on
tidal.com opens the track directly in tidalt:

```bash
tidalt setup
```

Optionally install tidalt as a systemd user service (starts at login, no
terminal window):

```bash
tidalt setup --daemon
```

---

On first launch you will be prompted to log in via the Tidal OAuth2 device flow. Your session is saved to the system keychain (or an age-encrypted file at `~/.config/tidalt/secrets`) and reused on subsequent runs.

## Features

- **Sidebar navigation** — a persistent left nav groups every section: Queue (with the hovered track's cover art), Playlists, Favorite Songs / Artists / Albums, Recently Played, Daily Mixes, Search, and Themes
- **Contextual action sheet** (`o`) — from any track, open a popup of actions: play now, play next, add to queue, add to playlist, start radio, go to artist/album, favorite, copy link
- **Command palette** (`:` or `Ctrl+P`) — fuzzy-run any action or jump to any section
- **Hybrid queue / playlist model** — the queue is your live workspace; opening a saved playlist loads it and tracks its origin. The header shows `synced`, `edited — S save`, or `radio · unsaved — S save`, and `S` saves the queue as a new playlist. Edits never silently change a saved playlist
- **First-class favorites** — browse favorite songs, artists, and albums as their own sections
- **Grouped search** — results are split into Songs / Artists / Albums; drill into an artist or album from any hit
- **Import from Spotify** — paste a Spotify track or playlist URL (command palette → "Import from Spotify…") and tidalt finds each song on Tidal, flagging anything it can't match as _not available_; then create a Tidal playlist or load the matches into the queue. No Spotify login required. See [docs/spotify-import.md](docs/spotify-import.md)
- **In-app theme picker** — eight built-in color schemes (TIDALT, Catppuccin, Tokyo Night, Gruvbox, Nord, Rosé Pine, Dracula, Amber CRT) plus an "Auto — match terminal" option, with live preview as you move the cursor; the choice is persisted
- Artist view — browse an artist's full discography and play everything, their top tracks, or a single album
- Song radio — build a queue of similar tracks for any song
- Shuffle (Fisher-Yates pre-shuffle or random pick)
- Bit-perfect FLAC playback via direct ALSA `hw:` — bypasses PipeWire/PulseAudio entirely (see [fixed-format devices](#fixed-format-audio-interfaces))
- **Shared output mode** — pick `default` in the device selector to play through the system mixer instead of claiming the card, so other applications keep their audio (see [shared output mode](#shared-output-mode))
- Auto-negotiates the best PCM format your DAC supports
- Auto-advances through the queue; respects shuffle mode
- Volume control and output device selection, both persisted between sessions
- Session and playback position restored on next launch
- MPRIS2 registration — media keys and `playerctl` work without TUI focus
- Daemon mode — run headless in the background, control via TUI client or playerctl

See [docs/ui.md](docs/ui.md) for a full tour of the interface.

## Keybindings

### In-TUI

The interface has two focus zones: the **sidebar** (section navigation) and the
**main pane** (the selected section's content). `h` / `l` move focus between them.

| Key                | Action                                                        |

### Global shortcuts (MPRIS2)

> **Daemon mode required.** These shortcuts only work when `tidalt` is running as a background daemon (via `tidalt setup --daemon` / systemd). A plain `tidalt` TUI session does not register a persistent MPRIS2 service, so media keys and `playerctl` will have no effect when the TUI is closed.

When the daemon is running, `tidalt` registers as an MPRIS2 media player so playback can be controlled from any MPRIS2 client — `playerctl`, KDE Connect, your desktop environment's media key handler — without a TUI open.

#### Standard media keys

Many keyboards and desktop environments map dedicated media keys directly to MPRIS2:

| Key        | Action         |
| ---------- | -------------- |
| `fn` + `.` | Play / pause   |
| `fn` + `,` | Previous track |
| `fn` + `/` | Next track     |

These are handled by your desktop environment via MPRIS2 — tidalt does not implement any special key capture itself.

#### Custom bindings (65% keyboards)

On keyboards without dedicated media keys, bind [`playerctl`](https://github.com/altdesktop/playerctl) to custom shortcuts via your desktop environment:

| Shortcut | Action         |
| -------- | -------------- |
| `Alt+0`  | Previous track |
| `Alt+-`  | Play / pause   |
| `Alt+=`  | Next track     |

See [docs/media-keys.md](docs/media-keys.md) for full setup instructions.

## Supported DACs

Auto-detection scans `/proc/asound/cards`. Any ALSA-visible device can be selected manually with the `d` key.

| DAC                          |  Auto-detected   |
| ---------------------------- | :--------------: |
| Hidizs S9 Pro                |       Yes        |
| Hidizs S9 Pro Plus ("Martha") |       Yes        |
| Focusrite Scarlett Solo      |       Yes        |
| Any ALSA-visible device      | Manual (`d` key) |

### Shared output mode

Exclusive access is the point of the `hw:` path, but it is not always what you want: while a track plays, nothing else on the machine can use that card.

Selecting **`default`** in the device picker (`d`) switches to shared output. tidalt then plays through whatever ALSA resolves `default` to — the PipeWire or PulseAudio plugin on a desktop, `dmix` on a bare ALSA box — and the sound server keeps ownership of the card. Browser, game, and notification audio all keep working.

The trade-offs are explicit:

| | Exclusive (`hw:`) | Shared (`default`) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Other apps can play | No, while a track plays | Yes |
| Resampling | None | Whatever the sound server does |
| Bit-perfect | Yes | No |
| ReserveDevice1 handshake | Yes | Skipped |
| Gapless transitions | Yes | Yes |

Shared mode keeps the gapless machinery — the end-of-track `snd_pcm_drain` and the same-format transition that avoids reopening the device both work through the plug layer. What it gives up is the bit-perfect guarantee, and the now-playing bar says so: the quality badge is marked `(shared)`, distinct from the `(converted)` marker used when a device refuses the format and is downgraded without being asked.

The choice is persisted like any other device selection.

### Fixed-format audio interfaces

Most DACs let tidalt negotiate the stream's native shape on the `hw:` endpoint, which is what makes bit-perfect output possible. A few USB audio interfaces — Focusrite's Vocaster line, for example — instead expose a *fixed* native channel count, sample rate, and format, and reject anything else outright.

When tidalt detects that refusal it reopens the device through ALSA's plug layer (`plughw:`), which resamples and remixes to whatever the hardware accepts. Playback works, but the output is **no longer bit-perfect**. The now-playing bar makes this visible: the device readout shows the `plughw:` device actually in use, and the quality badge is marked `(converted)`.

This fallback only engages on a genuine format refusal. Transient failures — such as PipeWire not having finished releasing the device — are retried against `hw:` as before, so a device that can do bit-perfect output is never silently downgraded.
